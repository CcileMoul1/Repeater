# Repeater
Learn your lessons by being asked about it.
Every lesson you can write as a table could be studied with `repeater`. It will randomly select an element of the table and ask you to complete the row. `repeater`could be use to learn vocabulary, historical dates etc.

# Usage
## How to launch the program
For now, everything is directly written in the code. This will be changed at some point.

1. Write the lesson you want to study in a csv file.
2. Change the path to the file in the code (`csv_file = ...`)
3. Run the code with python (open a terminal, go to the repertory of the code and run `python main.py`)

## Dependencies
The following libraries are used
- random
- pandas

# Comment
Any advice on how to improve this readme or the programm (code or features) is welcomed
